## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project, I deepened my understanding of using Tailwind CSS. I learned how to effectively use Tailwind’s responsive utilities to manage the Desktop screen. Key takeaways include:

Ensuring interactive elements have hover states for better user experience.
For example, to apply specific colors within the design file to use throughout the project. I used:

```html
<button
  class="bg-white text-primary-darkCyan py-2 px-4 rounded-full border-2 border-transparent hover:border-white hover:bg-primary-darkCyan hover:text-neutral-transparentWhite"
>

</button>
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to explore more advanced Tailwind CSS features and enhance my skills in handling complex responsive designs. I also aim to integrate more interactive elements and animations to improve user engagement.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Essential for understanding Tailwind’s utility classes and responsive design options.
